This is an attempt to implement the Java Exams on Bank of Montreal.

You will find the Project Exams in the project folders called Java Assesment.

The pricing implmentation was done in two different ways, because of that, you will find classes called Future, Future2, Stock, Stock2, ProductTest and ProductTest2

You reviews are welcome.
